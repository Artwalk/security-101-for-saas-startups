## 我希望我第一个老板告诉我的一些事情
## Things I wish my first boss have told me

无论如何，你在创业公司工作了，之前你已经好奇应该关注哪些安全注意事项和遵守哪些规范，哪些技术债务应该推迟到之后的阶段，哪些系统应立即强化，主要的考虑因素是什么。

So you are working at a Startup, and you have been wondering at what point should you start looking into security considerations and compliance? Which technical debt should be postponed for a later stage, and which systems should be hardened this instant? What are the main considerations?

技术债债台高筑，只是在许多情况下以后还比现在容易。例如，如果你使用的 elasticsearch 没有用户名/密码，您应仔细检查您的防火墙设置。B轮后你的创业公司很可能会有足够的人力和预算，确保正确的 elasticsearch 群集。

Technical debt gets piled up, and in many cases it is easier to pay later rather than now. For example, if you are using elasticsearch without username/passwords, you should double check your firewall settings. After round-B your startup would probably have the manpower and budget to properly secure the elasticsearch cluster.

创业文化是有个难点是"以后改"。举个小🌰。习惯于没有代码审查直接推代码的开发人员，会抱怨同行审查会让开发陷入沼泽，而且对他们来说这甚至"太企业化"了。

Startup culture is a bit more difficult to change "later". Let's take a trivial example. Developers that are used to pushing code without code review, would complain that peer review would bog down the development, and it might even smell "too corporate" for them.

那么在早期阶段哪些安全注意事项最相关？ 

* 愿意为你产品付费的客户提出的安全问题

* 在你的行业 （医疗、 金融、 企业） 的安全要求有哪些？

* 目标市场 （国家） 条例（数据隐私、 数据驻留）是什么，欧洲人已知有更为严格的规定。美国不同的州有不同的规定。

* 哪些工具和政策不会伤害你的团队的道德。

* 它会花你多长时间去准备安全风险计划 （请参阅本文档底部的示例）

  * 知识产权盗窃、 商业计划盗窃、 比特币/ec2 偷窃、 丢失所有数据的影响是什么？它如何影响你的销售、 客户、 投资者？

  * 你如何针对数据泄露做保护？

  * 你怎么减少数据泄露的曝光？

So which security considerations are relevant at an early stage?

* What security concerns were raised by customers willing to pay for your product?

* What are the security expectations  in your industry (Medical, Finance, Enterprise)?

* What are the target market (country) regulations (Data Privacy, Data Residency)? Europeans are known to have tougher regulations. Different US States have different regulations.

* Which tools and policies would not hurt your team's' moral.

* How long would it take you to prepare a security risk plan (see example at the bottom of this document)

    * What is the impact of Intellectual Property theft, business plans theft, bitcoin/ec2 theft, losing all your data ? How would it affect your sales, customers, investors?

    * How can you protect against a data breach?

    * How can you reduce the exposure after a data breach?

我们把创业经历的不同阶段的安全预期的建议放在一起。创业公司有了更多钱和数据，越要增加对安全的投资︰

We grouped together the expected security recommendations by the different phases a start-up goes through. The more money and data the startup handles, the bigger the investment in security:
